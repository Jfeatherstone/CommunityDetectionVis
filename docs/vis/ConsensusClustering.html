        A list of or array of dimensions (M, N), where:

        M : The number of community detections to create the matrix from

        values that need to be included.

    returnNeighbors : bool

        a kd-tree.

def consensusCluster(pointArr, communityArr, consensusMatrixCalculationMethod=&#34;exact&#34;, fastMatrixNumNeighbors=8, fastMatrixMonteCarloStepFactor=1, numCommunityDetections=5, numHiddenDetections=3, gridPoints=60, resolutionCenter=.75, resolutionVar=.05, figOutputFolder=None, showIntermediateResults=False):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    A full pipeline method to go from a set of input community detections to a final consistent
    detection. The method goes through the following steps:

    1. Create a uniform set of points to describe each region (`gridPoints` x `gridPoints`).

    2. Ensure each detection is described by the exact same set of points by removing unique entries

    3. Calculate the consensus matrix (exactly or approximately) for all of the detections

    4. Perform community detection on the consensus matrix with randomly sampled louvain parameters (centered around
    (`resolutionCenter` with variance `resolutionVar`)

    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 several (`numHiddenDetections`) times

    6. Perform community detection one final time and return

    Parameters
    ----------

    pointArr : list(numpy.ndarray)
        The array of points that describes the region for each detection. Each detection does not need
        to have the same number/location of points, though the length of pointArr[i,:] should match
        communityArr[i,:].

    communityArr : list(numpy.ndarray) 
        The array of community assignments for each point in each community detections. Each detection does not need
        to have the same number/location of points, though the length of pointArr[i,:] should match
        communityArr[i,:].
    
    consensusMatrixCalculationMethod : str
        How to calculate the consensus matrix for the ensemble of community detections. Options are:

        &#39;exact&#39; : Calculate every element of the consensus matrix as the fraction of detections in which
            a given two points are in the same community. O(n^2) complexity.

        &#39;fast&#39; : Calculate only the nearest neighbors elements of each point as the fraction of detections
            in which a given two points are in the same community. Randomly sample points to fill in
            non-nearest neighbor edge weights, as described in:

            Tandon, A., Albeshri, A., Thayananthan, V., Alhalabi, W., &amp; Fortunato, S. (2019). Fast consensus clustering in complex networks. Physical Review E, 99(4), 042301. [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.042301](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.042301)

            Approximately O(n) complexity.

    fastMatrixNumNeighbors : int
        The number of neighbors to exactly calculate the consensus matrix edges weights for when
        using the fast matrix calculation.

    fastMatrixMonteCarloStepFactor : int
        The factor by which to multiply the number of points by to get the total number of Monte
        Carlo steps when using the fast matrix calculation. That is, the total number of sampled
        points (other than nearest neighbors) will be the number of points times this value.

    numComunityDetections : int
        The number of community detections to generate from each consensus matrix.

    numHiddenDetections : int
        The number of times to calculate the consensus matrix and then perform community detection.
        Higher number will give the system more time to come to an agreement on the final detection.
        Exact consensus matrix calculation converges faster than fast calculation (as expected).

    gridPoints : 60
        The number of grid points in each direction when creating a uniform grid across the region.
        Actual number of points will end up being less than square of this value, since some points
        will be outside the region.

    resolutionCenter : float
        The center of the sampling distribution for generating values of the louvain resolution
        parameter. Should be between .2 and 2 (approximately).

    resoltionVar : float
        The variance of the sampling distribution for generating values of the louvain resolution
        parameter. Higher variance may require higher numHiddenDetections to converge.

    figOutputFolder : str
        The output folder to save the figures for the initial detections, the hidden detections,
        and the final result. If None, no figures will be saved.

    showIntermediateResults : bool
        Whether to show the initial and hidden detections alongside the final detection (True) or
        just show the final detection (False).


    Returns
    -------

    (numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray) : The final set of points describing the region (1st element) and the
        community assignments for each point (2nd element).
