def concaveHull(points, communities, alpha=.018):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Calculate the concave hull (external boundary) for a set of points, while also
    keeping track of the communities for each boundary point.

    Parameters
    ----------

    points : numpy.ndarray or list
        A set of points of shape (N, 2).

    communities : numpy.ndarray or list
        The community assignments for each point in points.

    alpha : float
        The alpha parameter for creating the hull; determines how angular or concave
        the final result is. Default value was choosen by using the alphashape.optimize
        function. If value is set to None, this method will be run explicitly to find
        a good value (though it takes a significantly longer period of time).

    Returns
    -------

        the communities that each point in each line belongs to (2nd element). Individual hull lines are
        formatted as:
